  bio : "Tzihong Chiueh was born in Hsi-Tser (汐止), Taipei County, Nov. 29, 1955.  He obtained BS/Physics, MS/Physics and PhD/Physics in 1978, 1980 and 1985 from NTU, UCLA and UT Austin, respectively.  During 1985 to 1989, he worked as a postdoc fellow in University of Colorado in Boulder.  In 1989, he joined Physics Department, National Central University as a faculty member, and in 1992 he became a faculty member of the then newly formed Institute of Astronomy, National Central University, also serving as the Director.  Since 1998, he joined Physics Department NTU as a faculty member.  He also holds a joint appointment with Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) ever since 1993.  In 1997-1999, he serves in National Science Council as the Co-Chairman of the Physics Research Review Committee.

      Tzihong Chiueh’s research interests include Theoretical Astrophysics, Computational Astrophysics and Astrophysics instrumentations.  He was awarded with the Outstanding Research Awards of National Science Council in 1991, 1994 and 2003, and was appointed as the NTU Distinguished Professor since 2007."

       Research purpose:
       The feature of a wave dark matter soliton does not shown in the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies. The random motion of the soliton and the high velocity dispersion near the galactic center may slow down the rotation speed and erase the feature of the soliton. To prove this statement, the mock observations of GAMER simulations of galactic disks inside a wave dark matter halos are compared to the observations."

  bio : "I was joining this lab at November 8th,2019 and my topic is soliton random walk in psidm simulation based on the paper 'Soliton Random Walk and the Cluster-Stripping Problem in Ultralight Dark Matter' by professor Hsi-Yu Schive, Tzihong Chiueh, and Tom Broadhurst. The object about this topic is finding out why will soliton random walk in the simulation? Did it affect by gluon or halo potential or something else? In advance , if we assure that the soliton random walk can be reproduce by local domain, we can even produce the simulation of Milky Way soliton random walk regardless of the extensive and massive loading on simulating the whole Milky Way. My job here is simulating different kind of halo and analyzing their soliton random walk to discover what behind them. It is a pleasure to learn in this lab and professor's teaching.  This is a fascinating subject to work on. "
